# Put here the correct location for your SSL certs. Now the inventories are
# using this self-signed ubuntu cert
#
# ssl_certificate_server_dir=/etc/ssl/
# ssl_cert_file=certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
# ssl_key_file=private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
#
# If you want to use letsencrypt, you can set something similar to:
#
# ssl_certificate_server_dir=/etc/letsencrypt/live/vtatlasoflife.org
# ssl_cert_file=fullchain.pem
# ssl_key_file=privkey.pem
#
# With letsencrypt, is recommended to use one cert with multiple domains to
# make the configuration of the inventories more simple
#
# You can transfer the cert between machines after renewal via hooks (or
# using a shared folder via NFS, etc). See:
#
# https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewing-certificates
